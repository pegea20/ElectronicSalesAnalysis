# PRACTICAL CASE: SALES ANALYSIS


This dataset contains hundreds of thousands of purchases made in an electronics store, broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, and more.

In order to analyze the purchases and identify patterns, this notebook includes:

- Data cleaning and formatting

- Data analysis

- Data visualization

The final conclusions were:

1. December was the month with the highest number of sales.

2. AAA Batteries were the most popular product.

3. At the same time, AAA Batteries were the cheapest product in the store.

4. The variables “Quantity Purchased” and “Price” showed an inverse relationship: the cheapest product was the most sold, while the most expensive product was the least sold.
